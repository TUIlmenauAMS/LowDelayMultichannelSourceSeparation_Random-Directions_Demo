# Online Multichannel Source Separation Random-Directions Demo
Online multichannel audio source separation demo, including the random directions software for own experiments. You can run the separation software in the notebook by running the cells, and listen to the result. Either the audio source file for the room simulation can be replaced, or other multichannel audio files, which already contain mixed audio sources, can be uploaded and used as input.
