# Online Multichannel Source Separation Random-Directions Demo
Online multichannel audio source separation demo, including the random directions software for own experiments. You can run the separation software in the notebook by running the cells, and listen to the result. Either the audio source file for the room simulation can be replaced, or other multichannel audio files, which already contain mixed audio sources, can be uploaded and used as input. You can change the sources in the room simulation in line 7, "files=", of the cell "Simulated Room", or by providing a multichannel mixed file with different name in line 6.
To let it run in Google Colab, click on the colab button, and then, for instance, Runtime-Run all.
